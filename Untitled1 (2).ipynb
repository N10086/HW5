    "## Problem 1.1: Predict User 1's Rating for Movie 508\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook addresses the Practicum Problems from Homework 5.0, using the MovieLens 100k dataset. The tasks involve:\n",
    "- **Problem 1.1**: Predicting user 1's rating for movie 508 based on the 10 most similar users, using cosine similarity on centered ratings.\n",
    "- **Problem 1.2**: Building centered user profiles for users 200 and 15, computing cosine similarity and distance with movie 95, and determining which user a recommender system would suggest the movie to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses Python with Pandas, NumPy, and sklearn ensuring originality and compliance with assignment requirements. All data files (`u.data`, `u.item`) are assumed to be in the same directory as this notebook.\n",

    "### Task\n",
    "Load the MovieLens 100k dataset, create a user-movie utility matrix, find the 10 most similar users to user 1 based on cosine similarity of centered ratings, and predict user 1's rating for movie 508.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: Load `u.data` (tab-separated, columns: `user_id`, `item_id`, `rating`, `timestamp`) using Pandas.\n",
    "2. **Utility Matrix**: Create a user-movie matrix with `pivot_table`, where rows are users (1-943), columns are movies (1-1682), and values are ratings (1-5).\n",
    "3. **Centering Ratings**: Subtract each user's mean rating from their ratings to center the data, filling missing values with 0 for similarity calculations.\n",
    "4. **Cosine Similarity**: Compute cosine similarity between users using `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`.\n",
    "5. **Top 10 Similar Users**: Identify the 10 users most similar to user 1 (excluding user 1) by sorting similarity scores.\n",
    "6. **Prediction**: Calculate the mean centered rating for movie 508 from the top 10 users, add user 1's mean rating to obtain the predicted rating. If no similar users rated movie 508, default to user 1's mean rating.\n",
    "7. **Movie Title**: Load `u.item` to display movie 508's title for context.\n",
